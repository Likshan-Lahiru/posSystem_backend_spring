## **Project Overview**
This project is a fully functional **RESTful API** built using **Spring Web MVC**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Hibernate** for database management with **MySQL**. The API is designed to follow a well-structured layered architecture for scalability and maintainability.

The project includes:
- **Spring Web MVC** for building the web interface.
- **Spring Data JPA** for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **AJAX (or Fetch API)** for client-side requests and responses.
- **Logging** to track application events at appropriate levels.
- Complete **API documentation** linked below for reference.
- A suitable **license** for open-source or commercial use.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Spring Web MVC)
- **ORM**: Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: AJAX (or Fetch API for asynchronous data handling)
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback (or another logging framework)
- **Testing**: JUnit and Mockito (optional but recommended)

## **Project Architecture**
The application is structured in layers, following best practices for clean and maintainable code:
1. **Controller Layer**: Exposes RESTful APIs to the clients, handling HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and orchestrates operations between the Controller and the Data Access layer.
3. **Repository Layer**: Uses **Spring Data JPA** to interact with the MySQL database via **Hibernate**.
4. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used for transferring data between the layers and ensuring separation of concerns.
5. **Entity Layer**: Represents the database schema with JPA annotations, ensuring proper persistence.

## **Key Features**
- **RESTful API**: Offers endpoints to manage resources (CRUD operations).
- **AJAX-based Frontend**: Implements asynchronous API calls using **fetch()** for a seamless user experience.
- **Spring Data JPA with Hibernate**: Simplifies database interactions by leveraging ORM and repository patterns.
- **Proper Logging**: Logs messages at appropriate levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) using SLF4J and Logback for better monitoring and debugging.
- **API Documentation**: A complete set of API documentation for developers and users, detailing the endpoints, request formats, and responses.

## **Logging**
The application uses **SLF4J** with **Logback** for efficient logging management. Each log entry is categorized by levels such as:
- **INFO**: Tracks general information about the application's state.
- **DEBUG**: Provides detailed output for debugging purposes.
- **ERROR**: Logs critical failures and exceptions.

Log files are stored in the `logs/` directory and can be configured through the `logback.xml` file.

## **API Documentation**
You can view the complete API documentation [here](./api-documentation.md), which includes:
- Endpoints for each resource.
- Expected input parameters (request bodies, query parameters).
- Response format and status codes.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. Configure the MySQL database connection in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## **API Endpoints Overview**
The API supports basic CRUD operations for resources. Below is a quick overview of key endpoints:
- `GET /api/resources`: Fetch all resources.
- `GET /api/resources/{id}`: Fetch a resource by its ID.
- `POST /api/resources`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resources/{id}`: Update an existing resource by ID.
- `DELETE /api/resources/{id}`: Delete a resource by ID.

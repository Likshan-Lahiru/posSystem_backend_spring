Certainly! To include your frontend URL in the README file, you can add a dedicated section that provides information about the frontend application, including its URL. This will help users understand how to interact with both the backend API and the frontend interface.

Below is the updated README with the **Frontend** section added. Replace `https://your-frontend-url.com` with your actual frontend URL.

# **Spring Boot RESTful API Project**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a fully functional **RESTful API** built using **Spring Web MVC**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Hibernate** for database management with **MySQL**. The API is designed to follow a well-structured layered architecture for scalability and maintainability.

The project includes:
- **Spring Web MVC** for building the web interface.
- **Spring Data JPA** for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **AJAX (or Fetch API)** for client-side requests and responses.
- **Logging** to track application events at appropriate levels.
- Complete **API documentation** linked below for reference.
- A suitable **license** for open-source or commercial use.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Spring Web MVC)
- **ORM**: Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: AJAX (or Fetch API for asynchronous data handling)
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback (or another logging framework)
- **Testing**: JUnit and Mockito (optional but recommended)

## **Project Architecture**

The application is structured in layers, following best practices for clean and maintainable code:

1. **Controller Layer**: Exposes RESTful APIs to the clients, handling HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and orchestrates operations between the Controller and the Data Access layer.
3. **Repository Layer**: Uses **Spring Data JPA** to interact with the MySQL database via **Hibernate**.
4. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used for transferring data between the layers and ensuring separation of concerns.
5. **Entity Layer**: Represents the database schema with JPA annotations, ensuring proper persistence.

## **Key Features**
- **RESTful API**: Offers endpoints to manage resources (CRUD operations).
- **AJAX-based Frontend**: Implements asynchronous API calls using **fetch()** for a seamless user experience.
- **Spring Data JPA with Hibernate**: Simplifies database interactions by leveraging ORM and repository patterns.
- **Proper Logging**: Logs messages at appropriate levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) using SLF4J and Logback for better monitoring and debugging.
- **API Documentation**: A complete set of API documentation for developers and users, detailing the endpoints, request formats, and responses.

## **Frontend**

The frontend application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the RESTful API. It communicates with the backend using AJAX (or Fetch API) to perform asynchronous operations, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **Frontend URL**: https://github.com/Likshan-Lahiru/pos_system.git
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design for various devices.
  - Real-time data updates without full page reloads.
  - User authentication and authorization (if applicable).
  - Interactive forms for creating and updating resources.

**Note**: Ensure that the frontend is configured to communicate with the backend API's base URL. You might need to update environment variables or configuration files in the frontend project to point to the correct API endpoints.

## **Logging**

The application uses **SLF4J** with **Logback** for efficient logging management. Each log entry is categorized by levels such as:
- **INFO**: Tracks general information about the application's state.
- **DEBUG**: Provides detailed output for debugging purposes.
- **ERROR**: Logs critical failures and exceptions.

Log files are stored in the `logs/` directory and can be configured through the `logback.xml` file.

## **API Documentation**

You can view the complete API documentation [here]([./api-documentation.md](https://www.postman.com/supply-engineer-31331527/possystem-spring/collection/vc5wb07/possystem-spring?action=share&creator=36186170)), which includes:
- Endpoints for each resource.
- Expected input parameters (request bodies, query parameters).
- Response format and status codes.

## **API Endpoints Overview**

The API supports basic CRUD operations for resources. Below is a quick overview of key endpoints:

- `GET /api/resources`: Fetch all resources.
- `GET /api/resources/{id}`: Fetch a resource by its ID.
- `POST /api/resources`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resources/{id}`: Update an existing resource by ID.
- `DELETE /api/resources/{id}`: Delete a resource by ID.
